<p>~ from Canvas:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This course involves the study of source recording, sonic manipulation and sonic installations. Although the course contains technical components, its focus is strictly aesthetic. A range of techniques will be examined, together with an investigation of current manifestations of Sonic Art in the UK and around the world, including installation art and bioacoustics.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Discussion and analysis of the potential links between sound, light, structure, ecology, location and image will lead to experiments and exercises in the aesthetic and technical creation of acousmatic spaces. Students will be expected to investigate their own performance/demonstration opportunities and compose/arrange/design their creations to take account of the site-specific performance/exhibition space.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Students will provide their collected exercises in a portfolio including a critical evaluation placing the student’s work in the context of current trends in sonic art as well as providing a basis for the students own criteria and judgement.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The point is…whether in our schools of serious music we shall confine ourselves to finer and still finer degrees of perfection in the “interpretation” of past treasures, whether we shall go on devouring or unconsciously absorbing vibrating frankfurters to the point of melomaniacal satiety at which our appetite vanishes, or whether some few of us will chuck the music school, turn off the radio, and go into the kitchen and cook ourselves a nourishing meal. ~ Harry Partch: Genesis of a Music</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Last week’s tasks:</p>

<p>1) refine your keywords;</p>

<p>2) write a good draft for an abstract;</p>

<p>3) use the keywords to look for references, ideas, books, academic
papers, in</p>

<p>3.1. google scholar;
3.2. the online library;
3.3. the university library (the real/physical one with books you
can touch and smell);</p>

<p>4) look through all Richard’s material I sent you a few weeks ago.</p>

<p>Add notes from 1-4 to your logbook.</p>

<p>The presentation discusses what ‘Sound Art’ is with examples from Edison onwards. Some brief notes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Edison - sound recording helps to create an alternative to performed sound</li>
  <li>Russolo - noise should be appreciate as sound as well, not just orchestral sounds</li>
  <li>Kurt Switters</li>
  <li>Pierre Schaeffer - edited recordings of sounds, concrete music vs abstract music, abstract music is traditional music in his ears</li>
  <li>Halim El-Dabh - recordings</li>
  <li>John Cage, <em>Silence</em>, 1952, “we cannot make silence”, sonic flux</li>
  <li>Max Neuhouse, <em>Listen</em>, 1966, soundwalk,  installations</li>
  <li>La Monte Young, <em>Dream House</em>, 1969, vedic metaphysic, inside vs outside</li>
  <li>Tania Mauraud, connection to a visual arts;</li>
  <li>Robert Morris, <em>Box, …</em></li>
  <li>Alvin Lucier, <em>I’m sitting in a Room</em>, 1970,  repetition of recording, resonant frequencies</li>
  <li>Maryanne Amacher, <em>Synaptic Island</em>, 1992</li>
  <li>shift for the meaning of sound art: late 90’s early 20’s</li>
  <li>Christian Marclay, <em>Chorus II</em>, 1998, <em>The Sound of Silence</em>, 1988, no sound</li>
  <li>Steve Roden, <em>Letter Forms</em>, 2002, translation of sound into physical object</li>
  <li>Jennie C. Jones, <em>Decrescendo with Ledger Tone</em>, 2014, acoustic panel used to visualize phrases in a piece of music</li>
  <li>Christine Sun Kim, <em>All Day</em>, 2012, deaf artist, graphic notation, sign language, <em>Bounce House Tokyo</em>, 2015, sounds below 20 Herz</li>
  <li>R. Murray Schafer, <em>The Soundscape</em>, book;</li>
  <li>Jana Winderen: “Disko Bay”, 2007, she connects her interests in fish and sound</li>
  <li>Emeka Ogboh, <em>Lagos Soundscape</em>, 2008, archiving changes in a city’s soundscape</li>
  <li>Akio Suzuki, <em>Oto date, listen point</em>, 1996, the artist marks locations in the city where he invites people to listen, soundwalk</li>
  <li>Christina Kubisch, <a href="https://www.christinakubisch.de/en/works/electrical_walks"><em>Electrical Walk</em></a>, 2006, soundwalk, soundwalk like minimal techno, listening to machines)</li>
  <li>Ultra Red and Guests, <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=Ultra+Red+and+Guests+What+is+the+Sound+of+Freedom%3F&amp;t=brave&amp;ia=web"><em>What is the Sound of Freedom?</em></a>, 2012, political, inspired by Cage, militant sound investigation</li>
  <li><a href="http://lawrenceabuhamdan.com/">Lawrence Abu Hamdan</a>, <em>Earshot</em>, 2016, political project, forensic listening, also check <a href="https://www.forensic-architecture.org/">Forensic Architecture</a></li>
  <li>Luke Fowler, <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=Luke+Fowler%3A+A+Grammar+for+Listening&amp;t=brave&amp;ia=web"><em>A Grammar For Listening</em></a>, 2009, video and sound have equal importance in the artwork</li>
  <li>Lucien Castaing-Taylor &amp; Véréna Paravel, <em>Leviathan</em>, 2012, film as sound art</li>
</ul>

<p>other ideas:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Cage: art has to imitate nature, its purposelessness;</li>
  <li>Lucier: sound as wavelengths;</li>
  <li>not all sound art makes sound;</li>
  <li>modes of sound art: soundwalk, soundscape, installation, film and video;</li>
  <li>visual art is everywhere, sound art is still not everywhere, why?</li>
  <li>when we start listening differently, by shifting attention, we will design our own soundworld (Schafer);</li>
  <li>psychical space, virtual and psychological space;</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="the-turner-price">The Turner Price</h3>
<p>BBC documentary</p>

<p>from 1984; why was it started? is controversial good? private source cash; are artists in competition with each other? the best and the worst artist is the same in one year; arts’ power to change things; “art to exhibit and having it operate in the world” is important, not the price; art in social enterprice; when it started no one liked modern art, now (perhaps with the help of this price) people like it more;</p>

<p>Part 3: White (BBC documentary)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Dr James Fox explores how, in the hands of artists, the colours gold, blue and white have stirred emotions, changed behaviour and even altered the course of history. In the Age of Reason, it was the rediscovery of the white columns and marbles of antiquity that made white the most virtuous of colours. For flamboyant JJ Wickelmann and British genius Josiah Wedgwood, white embodied all the Enlightenment values of justice, equality and reason.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Photographer Andrew Heptinstall is embarking on a quest to see whether a photograph can deliver information over and above a pure image; details of the sound of a place that only the photographer could have known at the time of its capture. He spends a day on Hadrian’s Wall in Northumberland with blind contemporary photographer Rosita McKenzie and meets Professor Fiona Macpherson, a philosopher from Glasgow University to gain an insight into human senses and perception. His many attempts over 6 months to capture the quality of sound within his images take him on a journey as far as Australia; yet he is only at the beginning of his journey as he continues to search for An Image of Sound. ~BBC4</p>

<p>The assignments should be considered as your own projects, not something you have to do for me or the university. Follow the rules outlined in the module guide, assessment criteria, etc., however, please keep in mind that the outcomes of your assignments can (and should) become part of your professional portfolios, which you later can use for networking, job hunting, etc.</p>

<p>Due to different student experience and expectations, this outline can be subject to change. Detailed notes for each week will be added gradually to this website.</p>
