## Note
- use make serve on localhost;
- maybe with custom domain - the url will have to be changed;
- refine permalinks (url and baseurl) knowledge;
- add nav menu idea to frame;

## Todo
- have two menus: one for social, one for pages: look into block elements?
- center and style menu;
- how to use a custom class or id for the logo li?

## Todo later
- night mode (flip black & white?)
- is class needed in config.yml?
- how to add svg instead of png as logo?
- how could I have pages in the pages folders
- shall I add drafts?
- maybe we could keep contact in the footer (and the menu just send the anchor there instead of having a separate page? put then we don't have a message box in case needed - do people now have a emails?)
- is the sass variebl needed in the config file?
- refine breaking point: https://www.quora.com/What-is-breakpoint-in-responsive-web-design
