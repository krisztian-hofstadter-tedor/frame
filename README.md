## Note
- use 'make serve' on localhost;
- maybe with custom domain - the url will have to be changed;

## Todo
- shall we add svg as logo?
- have logo, menu and content in one vertical line;
- how to align text in nav boxes to left?
- have all social elements and extra info in footer;
- how to add index loop (with feature image)?
- how to add categories, tags and searches?

## Todo later
- learn more about permalinks (url and baseurl);
- night mode (flip black & white?)
- is class needed in config.yml?
- how could I have pages in the pages folders (instead in the root?)
- how to add drafts?
- maybe we could keep contact in the footer (and the menu just send the anchor there instead of having a separate page? put then we don't have a message box in case needed - do people now have a emails?)
- is the sass variable needed in the config file?
- refine breaking point: https://www.quora.com/What-is-breakpoint-in-responsive-web-design
