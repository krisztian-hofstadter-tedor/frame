## Note
- use make serve on localhost;
- maybe with custom domain - the url will have to be changed;

## Todo
- make menu links work in GitHub; 
- center and style menu;

## Todo later
- is class needed in config.yml?
- how could I have pages in the pages folders
- shall I add drafts?
- maybe we could keep contact in the footer (and the menu just send the anchor there instead of having a separate page? put then we don't have a message box in case needed - do people now have a emails?)
- is the sass variebl needed in the config file?
- refine breaking point: https://www.quora.com/What-is-breakpoint-in-responsive-web-design
